# Image Workflow and Style Guide

This document details requirements for image creation, editing and management, including licensing. It is meant as a template for any individual or organization, though there are specific requirements that may not apply.

## Image Dimensions and Sizes

-

Step 1: Select 30-50 images from the 900+ image set
Step 2: Create .PSD file and export a small JPG image to show to Jeff/Todd to confirm selection (place in dropbox with naming convention)
Step 3: Once confirmed, enter names into spreadsheet http://goo.gl/z5pFpN
Step 4: Modify PSD files for color correction, white balance, highlights, sharpness, etc., save PSD
Step 5: Crop/Resize and Export JPG files at the following resolutions (but do not save crop/resize data to the PSD):

- Landscape images:
    - 1920x1080 (1:1.78)
    - 680x480 (1:1.42)
    - 260x185

- Portrait images:
    - 680x960 (1:0.711)
    - 260x370

Note the naming system should be for example:

- elephant-bath-01.jpg (original jpg image from camera)
- elephant-bath-01.xcf (image corrected, uncropped/unresized image)
- elephant-bath-01-1920x1080.jpg (HD-sized image)
- elephant-bath-01-680x480.jpg (body-sized image)
- elephant-bath-01-260x185.jpg (sidebar/thumbnail-sized image)

For a portrait original (or where the image is best treated as a portrait out of the image):

- elephant-bath-02.jpg (original jpg image from camera)
- elephant-bath-02.psd (image corrected, uncropped/unresized image)
- elephant-bath-03-680x960.jpg (ebook-sized image)
- elephant-bath-03-260x370.jpg (sidebar/thumbnail-sized image)



Image Style Guide

Here are some guidelines that should help photographers and photo editors. If the photographer or editor does not understand or has any questions about these I am happy to meet/discuss. This will help us quite a bit as these guidelines mean we will have high quality, usable and effective images for the website/books as well as display advertisements. This should mean more customers.

PHOTO SHOOTING GUIDELINES

- We want Landscape photos (longer in width than in height). These are predominantly what we use so a lot of portrait shots are not useful. We can always crop portraits for interesting Thumbnail sized portrait images on the website. Shoot Landscape.

- Use HDR when possible. Good HDR helps a lot especially with outside shots that have bright sun or both light and shadow. It is better to use HDR in-camera instead of trying to do corrections. Of course HDR can have a problem with speed, especially moving subjects. HDR can help make photos better before editing. However, HDR is not best on every occasion, so use judgement or take two photos (the iPhone 5 can automatically shoot an HDR and a non-HDR at the same time).

- RAW is not necessary (and can slow down the photographer, especially when trying to use HDR. There has never been a point when we are making images for the web and for books, when RAW actually helps. RAW images are much larger and can require additional editing. In most cases, shooting RAW is simply a waste of time and energy. Good, large JPG images are fine, and that is what we want.

- Smiling, laughing people are the goal. People show happiness by smiling and laughing. These kinds of images are very useful. Frowns and neutral faces do not encourage people to buy. Sometimes people smile with their eyes.

- Images need to be in focus. Blurry faces are not usable.

- Images should have a good straight, head-on view of the subjects. Shoot at the same level as the subjects, especially heads and faces. Do not shoot or angle the camera lens below them or above them. Shoot straight across the horizon rather than at an angle away from the subjects. Have the camera frame in line with the horizon so the image does not need to be rotated.

- Do not shoot subjects who have a shadow pattern across their face, or bright sun in their face. Use a reflector to project soft light, or filter sun. Squinting eyes from too much sun, or a face in shadow does not look good and we prefer not to use it.

- Have photos with a mix of subjects, many people in the picture. It is best to have both boys and girls together, men and women together. Photos with a group of people interacting or hanging out in the same place, both local and foreign people together is best.

- Photos showing authentic activity are much, much better than staged/posed photos. Some staged photos are fine, especially showing a group together, but action photos, activity photos are more in need. We need both, but more action/activity photos.

- Photos of locations should have people in them, not empty rooms and buildings. For example, a photo of a classroom should have at least one person in that room. A photo of a bedroom or kitchen should have staff. Photos of bathrooms do not need people, but it is best to put down the toilet seat (if there is one).

- Include nature in photos when possible. Besides plants, animals, trees, birds, etc.

- Do not shoot to the edges of the camera frame. In many cases we crop inside the image, so leave room on all sides to be cropped.

- Shoot at the highest resolution of the camera. Make sure as many pixes are being used as possible.

- Share images using a USB or SDCard if more than 10mb of files. Or better, use Dropbox (a pro subscription now supports 1TB (Terabyte of space = 1,000 GB) for $10/month.

PHOTO EDITING GUIDELINES

COLOR
- Always use Adobe RGB Color Profile, in all editing and format changes. We have a 100% RGB workflow even for our print.
- Calibrate monitor before editing. Here is how:

http://www.quickgamma.de/indexen.html
Also, this is a good resource - a basic overview/guide: http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-calibrate-your-monitor
There are images on the web that can be used to help calibrate/test by eye. There are several linked here on the second page: http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-calibrate-your-monitor/2
Here is the microsoft page on this topic: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Calibrate-your-display
Also, I highly recommend optimizing ClearType first, before calibration. And then do the optimization of ClearType AFTER the calibration. That should be optimal. (See about Cleartype and use the Cleartype Tuner) http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ClearType/tuner/tune.aspx
The main issues are to get the gamma correct, and of course have the colors be accurate.

WEBSITE
- Header image (full width) should be 980x200px (1:4.9) jpg, < 50kb
- Images in the body can be 680x480px for a good landscape jpg that should resize nicely, at < 75kb
- Thumbnails can be as small as 260x370px portrait or 260x185px landscape jpg, at < 20kb / 10kb
- Logo image should be 980x200 (1:4.9) png w/o transparency, at < 50kb (Inkscape/SVG file)
- Large versions of photos/images should also be produced for inclusion in video (e.g., 1920x1080px)
- Sidebar house ads should be 260x86px png w/o transparency, at < 15kb (Inkscape/SVG file)
- Sprites have limitations as well. All sidebar items and social media buttons should be implemented as a sprite.
- Favicons should be implemented as 32x32px PNG files renamed as favicon.ico.

### Ebook Image Dimensions

- Image dimensions needs to be exactly 680px in width and up to 960px in height, and no larger than 60kb
- For landscape image, that could be 680x480px (to maintain aspect ration of sqrt2), and no larger than 30kb
- Composite images are effective in many cases, but do not exceed dimensions above.
- Image size needs to be under 50kb per image, preferably averaging 40kb/image. This will allow us apx. 25 images/book without exceeding 1mb in size. Not only does Amazon charge per MB of download, but speed issues in turning pages on a kindle.
- Kindle Ebooks do not support PNG, so for tables or images with text, we need to use the GIF format.

### Video Image Dimensions

A 1920x1080px image should be copied out to be used in 1080p video. This can be 500kb or so.

IMAGE EDITING FORMATS

- Keep an original, an edited intermediate image (SVG, XCF, PSD (without layers), or AI), and final exported/resized images: (PNG/GIF for AI/SVG and JPG for XCF/PSD). This means there should be three files with different extensions but the same name.
- Exported files should have their dimensions on them, height by width.
- Naming convention: lower-case with hyphens, short and descriptive. If several images of the same kind, then use 01, 02, etc. as the differentiation. E.g.,

- elephant-bath-01-original.jpg
- elephant-bath-01.psd
- elephant-bath-01-680x480px.jpg

Please let me know if there are any questions or additions to make to this set of Guidelines.

## Social Media Images

For all Social Media profile images, use a 500x500px png with no transparency, ensure the profile image can support rounded corners (YouTube/Facebook) as well as a complete circular mask (G+). In some cases it is useful to create different profile images, optimizing for each social media platform.

- Facebook header 851x315px (1:2.70)
- Twitter header 1500x500px (1:3) but with less usable
- Google Plus header 1080x608px (1:1.78)

Note that for all headers there is unusable areas, so best to have an image that various cropping will not dramatically change the image or meaning.

## Apps

There are limitations for App images and icons as well.

## Compression Tools

It is best to use GIMP and do quality output of 85, then use Kraken <http://kraken.io> to do better compression.

## Advertising Images and Dimensions

There are text ads and display ads. In some cases display ads have a limit on the amount of text that can be in the image (Facebook has a 20% limit).

### Facebook Ads

Facebook ads should be 1200x628, though they do not display that large. The [Facebook Ads Guide](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/) has all the specification including various parameters depending on the ad type and goal (clicks, likes, etc.)


### Goolge Adsense Display Ads

There are a variety of dimensions to these ads. The key is to find the target site and measure the ads on that site.
