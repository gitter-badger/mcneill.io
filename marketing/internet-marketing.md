# Introduction  

Marketing and Internet marketing in particular, is too often seen as a form of selling, full of tricks, fraud, liars and spam. To the reader who finds that side of marketing exciting or worthy of attention, this book is a curse. May you rot in hell. 

However, as in Rilke's letters to a young poet, those who will never understand the essence of marketing nevertheless pass on this wisdom as if in a sealed letter in a language they cannot read.

This book is written for those who want to know how to genuinely and honestly market their own or other's products or services using the Internet. 

This is the first of two books on the topic, the second being **Innovation for Small Business**, and contains the same dedication and introductory statement.

## How to Read this Book

As with other practical books, this one is meant to as a *how to* guide. Essentially the book can be considered a checklist along with explanations to help with understanding. 


# Definitions of the Market  

Marketing requires a definition. Unfortunately there are at least three important but distinct definitions. This is the source of much confusion when using the term *market* or *marketing* in everyday conversation.

## The Market as a Group of Customers  

- Demographics
- Psychographics
- Similar needs

This is the **market as customers**.

## The Market as a Set of Sales Channels  

The second definition is the market as a marketplace. The market is one or more locations where sales (and distribution) takes place. This can of course be online on one's own website or larger ecommerce sites such as Amazon and Ebay. For digital media products this can include Apple and Google. This is the **market as sales**.

## The Market as a Set of Competitors  
 
The third definition has to do with the market as defined by competitors (either direct competitors or substitutes) who offer similar products or services. This is the **market as competition**.

Note that all three definitions of the market are valid and important. There are different questions and concerns when dealing with the market as customers, the market as sales, and the market as competitors. Small businesses must act in relation to the changes that take place within each aspect of the market.
