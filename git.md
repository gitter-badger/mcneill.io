# Git and Git Integrations

Git is a fundamental tool whose basic feature set is flexible and functional enough to turn into a platform not only for software development (source code control) but also publishing of all kinds.

Github is the web service which was the early mover advantage around git (though of course there are others), and Gitlab promises to be the install-it-yourself open source distribution of this kind of platform.

Around these platforms come integration and extension applications, which provide value by enhancing the platform value. for example: 

- Waffle.io provides easy to use Kanban views of Github issues, 
- Bee makes it easier to interact with issues across a multitude of repositories (in a different way than Waffle), and also do time tracking, 
- Gitter.im offers web chat boards tied to repositories or independent
