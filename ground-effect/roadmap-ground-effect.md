# Ground Effect

This will have roughly four parts:

- Learning to Fly, Aviation in general, how to think, and SE Asia in particular
- Aerodynamics, flight, Ground-Effect Vehicles and the advantages of this form of transportation
    - Legal aspects (boating vs. flying, captains vs. pilots, etc.)
    - Physics aspects
- Process of designing and developing such a device, and in particular in SE Asia
    - Airfoil selection, testing, model construction, full size, optimization issues such as polishing the airfoil to reduce drag, or the opposite having a dimpled surface like a golf ball
- Development over time and what that means for an idea you believe in
