# Marquette, Michigan (1968-1978)

For the formative years between the ages of 2 and 12 I lived in Marquette, Michigan. There were three places we stayed: A small university apartment complex, a large old house on Michigan Street, and a new house on Hampton Street (named Hampton Hill by my mother). It was one of the new houses on this new street. The hill being so steep that the snowplows (and cars) could not mount it after various snowstorms throughout the year.
